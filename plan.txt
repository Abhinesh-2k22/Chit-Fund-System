MongoDB would be better for user details because:
    User profiles often have varying attributes and MongoDB's flexible schema is perfect for this
    Easy to add new fields without schema migrations
    Better for storing nested data like address, preferences, etc.
    Good for storing user documents, profile pictures, and other unstructured data
    Better scalability for user-related operations
MySQL would be better used for:
    Financial transactions (where ACID compliance is crucial)
    Audit logs
    Payment records
    Bidding history
    Group financial summaries
    Reports that require complex joins and aggregations
Neo4j would be excellent for:
    User relationships and connections
    Group membership networks
    Trust relationships between users
    Referral networks
    Social connections within the platform
